# isabelle-hoare-partial
babby's first attempts at using isabelle to prove some trivial programs using hoare logic 

Put the files in this repo inside the $ISABELLE_HOME/src/HOL/Hoare/ directory. 

Also, I absolutely don't know anything about how to do proper proofs so I just used try (or borrowed lemmas from other files included in isabelle) which resulted in inelegant and brittle apply scripts with lots of unnecessary or irrelevant stuff.
